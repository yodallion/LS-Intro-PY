# Write a comprehension that creates a dict object whose keys
# are strings and whose values are the length of the corresponding
# key. Only keys with odd lengths should be in the dict. 
# Use the set given by 'my_set' as the source of strings.

my_set = {
    'Fluffy',
    'Butterscotch',
    'Pudding',
    'Cheddar',
    'Cocoa',
}

my_dict = { string: len(string) 
            for string in my_set
            if len(string) % 2 != 0 }
print(my_dict)

# LS solution was identical to mine, just with different
# variable names. 'my_dict' was 'result' and 'string' was 'name'.
