# Given a list: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "peach", "watermelon"]
# How would you determine the index of the fruit "cherry" in this list?
    By utilizing the list.index() method. If you already know that you're looking for the string "cherry" 
    and that is is located somewhere within a given list, you could simply call name_of_list.index('cherry') 
    which will return the zero-based index location of that element, in this case, '2'.
    If 'cherry' wasn't an element in the list, list.index() would raise a ValueError. 
    The 'in' keyword can be used to check if a given element is contained within a certain list.
