# "On line 5, SyntaxError: expected ':'" 

# "Syntax" in coding refers to the specific rules and structures that define how code is written and organized in 
# a particular programming language. Thus, a "SyntaxError" being raised means that some mistake has been made in 
# the way a piece of code is written. This is important since computers are dumb and code needs to be written in 
# such a way that it leaves as little ambiguity as possible for the machine reading it. A 'interpreter" for a 
# language can help clarify things for the computer, but it can only do so much.
