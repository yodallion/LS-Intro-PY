# Concatenate two strings, one with your first name and one with your last, 
# to create a new string with your full name as its value. For example, 
# if your name is John Doe, you should combine 'John' and 'Doe' to get 'John Doe'.

full_name = 'August ' + 'Payjack'
print(full_name)

# Alternatively

full_name = 'August' + ' ' + 'Payjack'
print(full_name)

# Simplified

print('August' + ' ' + 'Payjack')
