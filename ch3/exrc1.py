# Classify the following potential non-constant VARIABLE names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. 
# For the non-idiomatic and illegal names, explain your choice.

# index - idiomatic
# CatName - non-idiomatic, contains uppercase letters
# lazy_dog - idiomatic
# quick_Fox - non-idiomatic, contains uppercase letters
# 1stCharacter - illegal, starts with a digit
# operand2 - idiomatic
# BIG_NUMBER - non-idiomatic, contains uppercase letters (would be idiomatic for a constant)
# π - non-idiomatic, π is not an ASCII character

# Exercise 2 is the same question but for FUNCTIONS instead of variables. Both are considered
# identifiers and fall under the same rules, thus the answers should be exactly the same.
